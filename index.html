            <h2>BODY BUILDING</h2>
            <P>In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later
                individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size,
                conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the
                elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular
                dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and
                shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights enhanced at the last stage by a

            <h2>WEIGHT LIFTING</h2>
            <P>Weightlifting is one of the activities that, in conjunction with other exercise and proper diet, will
                improve overall health, physical performance, and mentality. First and foremost, the health benefits
                that come from weightlifting are numerous and immense. Weightlifting increases muscle strength and it
                increases bone density as well. Increase in bone density is one of the most beneficial side effects
                yielded by weightlifting strength training, and yoga. GYMSTER creates a
